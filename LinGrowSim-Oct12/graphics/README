This directory contains the graphics code. 

/cvers - the C version. No GUI, outputs data into a Glut window, with
          OpenGL graphics. This may be the starting place if a GUI
           toolkit other than GLOW is chosen. 

/cppvers - the C++ version. It's got to be C++ to incorporate the GLOW
            GUI toolkit.
