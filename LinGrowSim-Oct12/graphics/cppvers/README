This directory contains the code for the full C++, GUI version of the
graphics (see ../cvers for the earlier C version). I expect this
code will be the hardest to port to Windows, but it could 
theoretically go quite smoothly. 

To run:

./disp_buttons resultsdirectoryname dumpnumber

e.g. 
 
./disp_buttons ~/comp_3904_code/numcrunch/demodata 0

The control window is written with the GLOW toolkit (there is no GUI/
button interface with OpenGL) - the reason the code in this directory
is C++ (though much of the old graphics is 99% C). Two windows take
graphical output: the Glut window, which responds automatically to 
button pushes in the control window; and the 1st Glow window, which allows
for object rotation with mouse drags, but needs a window tap to update
values from the control window (*bug* - if this is fixed, we could
get rid of the Glut window). 

I chose GLOW for the GUI 1) because it seems it may be becoming a bit of a
standard in Linux applications (?), and 2) It is entirely based on OpenGL
rendering - so it should theoretically port to Windows. I.e., GLOW 
interfaces should look identical in Linux and in Windows. I'd prefer to 
stick with the GLOW interface in Windows, but if it seems entirely 
clunky to write in, or if the tools in, say, MS Vis. C/C++ are clearly 
superior for the Windows application, we could go that way. 

The programs:

Makefile - this is sort of a front-end for the Glow Makefile 
            (glow_base.Makefile) - which generates all kinds of
             dependency files, etc. The main thing is to list
              the location of GLOW, the necessary local source
               programs, and the necessary Glow modules for 
                the calls you're making. 
 
main.cpp,
memory.cpp,
dump.cpp,
triangle.cpp - Essentially the same as the copies in ../cvers

display.cpp - 90% the same as the version in ../cvers, but it 
               initiates Glow, instead of Glut (Glow starts Glut).

dispbuttons.cpp - This codes the control window, and button control
                   of the OpenGL coming out of display.cpp. This code
                    is mostly Glow calls. 

mandelgizmo.cpp - This is altered code from a Glow tutorial (lesson 5). 
                  Using a real Glow window lets me use the
                  GlowViewManipulator, which allows for mouse rotation
                  of the graphics object. I haven't been able to get
                  this window to refresh upon control window events, 
                  though, so I've also kept the original Glut window
                  open. 

./include/mandelgizmo.h,
./include/dispbuttons.h - Some important definitions here.
