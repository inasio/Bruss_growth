This directory contains the earlier, C, version for reading computational
data out via OpenGL graphics - into a Glut window, no GUI control. 

To use: 
    ./displayer resultsdirectoryname dumpnumber

For example:

  ./displayer ~/comp_3904_code/numcrunch/demodata 0

Will pull up the first dump (time = 0) of the demo results. Put in 
a 5 instead of the 0, and you get the computation at 
time = 2500 iterations. (This computation ran to 36,500 iterations, but 
makes a dump directory of 26 MB - too big for floppy distribution!)

Programs:

display.c - is the heart of it all. The other programs are somewhat
            peripheral bookeeping, and are similar to their versions
            in /numcrunch. Display.c is a mix of straight C code for
            undumping data from file, defining the graphics primitives
            (triangles) from this, initializing OpenGL and the Glut
            output window, and rendering. There is also a working
            function for Postscript output of the bitmap, and some non-working
            functions for other formats.
